# Project requirements document: Local groups

The following list of requirements is a draft for the local groups page:

- The page UI looks like this:
  - On desktop:
    - The page is divided into two columns.
    - The left column contains a list of local groups.
    - The right column contains a map with the location of the local groups.
  - On mobile:
    - The page is divided into one column.
    - At the top of the page, there is a fixed map with the locations of the local groups.
    - Overlayed over the map, there is a list of local groups. When scolling the window, the map stays fixed and the list of local groups scrolls over it.
- Generate an example list of local groups with the following fields:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Location (coordinates)
  - slug
