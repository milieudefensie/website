# Introduction

On this website, you will find documentation and strategy for the open source campaign website of Milieudefensie.

These articles are meant both for own internal staff to use (web developers, digital organizers, etc.), as well as for other organisations who are looking for inspiration for their own tech stack. By developing the Milieudefensie website as an open source project, we hope to stimulate collaboration among digital organizers and developers in the broader social change community.
